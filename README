This package includes a Pd object and a matching Arduino firmware.  It allows
you to control the Arduino board from Pd without having to program in
Arduino's C++

To use it, open Pd_firmware in Arduino and upload it to the board.  Open up
arduino-test.pd in Pd, then choose your serial port with the [open( message.
