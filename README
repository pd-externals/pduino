Pduino - improved
-----------------

All Pd patches are based on the official Pduino (version 0.5beta8)
maintained by Hans-Christoph Steiner. 


The goals of the improvements are:

  * Get rid of avoidable dependencies on other external/abstraction
    libraries (make it easier to use with Pd-vanilla setups)

  * Update help- and test-patches in accordance to current Firmata

  * Create 'intuitive' and easy-to-understand GOP abstraction


Dependencies:

  * comport
  
  * pdstring library from moocow
