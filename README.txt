This package includes a Pd object and a matching Arduino firmware.  It allows
you to control the Arduino board from Pd without having to program in
Arduino's C++

To use it, first unzip the included Firmata-2.1 firmware and follow the README
included in there.  Then you'll be able to choose firmware from Arduino
application, in the menu: File -> Open -> Examples -> Library-Firmata

Once you have uploaded a firmware to your Arduino board, open up
arduino-test.pd in Pd, then choose your serial port with the [open( message.

For more on Arduino, go to: http://arduino.cc

You can get more information about this firmware here:

WARNING!  This version of the arduino object for Pd will only work with 2.1
versions of Firmata.  It will NOT work with older versions of the firmware!
